# Bai - Releases repository
This repository is temporary for storing release informaation. When the app officially releases, the source code will be moved from the private repository to this public one.

### Why keep the source private?
In order to have a fighting chance against bots looking to create dozens of forks of the app on Google Play, I'm keeping it private so I can be the first one to release the app.
